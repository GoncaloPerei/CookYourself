web app to save your recipes
</pre>
</div>

With CookYourself you can save your favourite recipes and check them later when you're hungry.

## Concept

CookYourself was created as a project for a class in college. 
The challenge was to create an web app using HTML, CSS and JS within some ideias. I choose to do a recipes saver.

## Problem

Storing your recipes on a paper its not very convinient since you need physical space and in a long term will start to be stressing to search for a specific recipe. CookYourself will fix that dematerializing the process with storing recipes in your smarthphone your computer.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this projects were:
 - User can create a new recipe;
 - User can edit a recipe that was already created;
 - User can delete a certain recipe;
 - User can search up a specific recipe;
 - Recipes would be stored in a database;
